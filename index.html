					<h4>What?</h4>
					<p>With this development workflow your team will be able to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify High Value Issues</li>
						<li>Identify when they are stuck and what to do</li>
						<li>Build Features Faster</li>
						<li>Produce Evolution-Ready Code</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-justify">
						For this workflow to be successful, you <strong>MUST HAVE</strong> only one (or less) process for each problem the process is trying to resolve.
						Here we are trying to combine the least amount of processes to solve the most amount of issues that are commonly found during project management.

					<h4>Run a Design Sprint</h4>
					<p class="text-justify">
						There are many ways to do Design Sprints. How you do it depends on the project's <strong>time and budget.</strong>
						Although I highly recommend <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Design Sprints</a>, they can be unnecessarily long.
						It's more important to understand the goal of the Design Sprint and build a custom approach than following the guide step by step.
					</p>
					<p><strong>So what matters?</strong> A Design Sprint needs to answer these 4 key questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the problem you are solving? (Problem)</li>
						<li>How are you solving it? (Strategy)</li>
						<li>What milestones do you need to achieve? (Tactics)</li>
						<li>What does the solution look like? (Objectives)</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Here's an example</h5>
					<p>Suppose you own a shop and you want to reduce costs by improving inventory management</p>

					<div class="card-group">
						<div class="card card-outline-info">
							<div class="card-header bg-info">Problem</div>
							<div class="card-block">
								<p><strong>What is the problem you are solving? (Problem)</strong></p>
								<p>I can improve inventory management by:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>reducing time spent when I interact with my inventory (restocking and purchase orders)</li>
									<li>reducing the amount of resources I use to keep track of my inventory (people spent restocking, counting, or receiving orders)</li>
								</ul>
								<h5 class="text-center"><strong>I choose to reduce time spent</strong></h5>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="card card-outline-info">
							<div class="card-header bg-info">Strategy</div>
							<div class="card-block">
								<p><strong>How are you solving it? (Strategy)</strong></p>
								<p>I can reduce time spent on my inventories by:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>increasing speed of interactions with inventories</li>
									<li>decreasing visits to inventories</li>
								</ul>
								<h5 class="text-center"><strong>I choose to increase the speed of interactions</strong></h5>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="card card-outline-info">
							<div class="card-header bg-info">Tactics</div>
							<div class="card-block">
								<p><strong>What milestones do you need to achieve? (Tactics)</strong></p>
								<p>To increase the speed of interactions with inventories I need to</p>
								<ul>
									<li>organize my inventories and reflect this organization on a system so that anyone that understands the system can immediately understand the inventory</li>
									<li>synchronize sales to restock orders so less time is spent counting store inventory</li>
									<li>synchronize purchase orders to inventory so less time is spent organizing warehouse inventory</li>

								<p><strong>What does the solution look like? (Objectives)</strong></p>
								<p>To achieve my milestones, I need to build an application that looks like this (I didn't draw this):</p>
